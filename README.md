# leptos

This fork has a little change on [top of leptos v0.4.9](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/commit/e9deff52a7e955af9a34b1b7fb2fd27f4342c396) to enable `spawn_local` function in wasm32 server.

The main branch of leptos is always nightly and already has breaking changes for `v0.5.0`, so it is impossible to rebase entirely on top of that. We will introduce changes for `v0.5.0` when we have more time.
